# 📊 Data Collection Guide - 24-48 Hour Monitoring

## 🎯 Objective

Collect real-world performance data from all 3 chains (Polygon, BSC, Base) to determine:
- Which chain has the most arbitrage opportunities
- Which chain has the best spreads
- Which chain is most profitable
- Best time-of-day for each chain
- Best pairs per chain

---

## 🚀 Starting Data Collection

### Step 1: Final Pre-Flight Check
```bash
node scripts/test-multi-chain.js
```

**Expected:** All 3 chains show ✅ READY

### Step 2: Launch Multi-Chain Monitoring
```bash
node scripts/multi-chain-launcher.js
```

**What You'll See:**
- 🟣 Polygon opportunities in magenta
- 🟡 BSC opportunities in yellow
- 🔵 Base opportunities in blue
- Real-time opportunity count per chain
- Automatic status updates every 30 seconds

### Step 3: Let It Run
**Recommended Duration:** 24-48 hours

**Why This Long?**
- Capture different market conditions (high/low volatility)
- See time-of-day patterns (Asian/European/US trading hours)
- Measure consistency across multiple days
- Collect statistically significant sample size

---

## 📊 What to Watch For

### During Monitoring

**1. Opportunity Frequency**
```
[10:35:22] 🟣 Polygon ✅ Opportunity detected! Total: 3
[10:35:45] 🟡 BSC ✅ Opportunity detected! Total: 1
[10:36:12] 🟣 Polygon ✅ Opportunity detected! Total: 4
```

**Track:**
- Which chain detects opportunities most frequently?
- Are opportunities evenly distributed or clustered?
- Does frequency change at different times?

**2. Error Rates**
```
[10:40:15] 🟣 Polygon Error: WebSocket disconnected
[10:40:17] 🟣 Polygon ✅ Reconnected successfully
```

**Track:**
- Which chain has most errors?
- Are errors transient (auto-recover)?
- Do errors correlate with opportunity detection?

**3. System Stability**
```
Active Chains: 3/3
Total Opportunities: 47
Total Errors: 2
```

**Track:**
- Does system stay stable over hours?
- Memory usage (check Task Manager)
- CPU usage per chain

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Polygon (Predicted)
- **Frequency:** 0.5-1.0 opportunities/minute
- **Spread:** 0.6-1.2% average
- **Best Time:** High volatility periods
- **Stability:** Very stable (Alchemy WebSocket)

### BSC (Predicted)
- **Frequency:** 0.2-0.5 opportunities/minute
- **Spread:** 0.7-1.5% average
- **Best Time:** Asian trading hours (Binance)
- **Stability:** Stable (Binance official RPC)

### Base (Predicted)
- **Frequency:** 0.1-0.3 opportunities/minute
- **Spread:** 0.5-1.0% average
- **Best Time:** US trading hours (Coinbase)
- **Stability:** Stable (Alchemy WebSocket)

## 🛑 Stopping Collection

### When to Stop

**Option A: 24 Hours**
- Minimum recommended duration
- Captures full day/night cycle
- Good for initial comparison

**Option B: 48 Hours**
- Better statistical significance
- Captures weekend vs weekday patterns
- Ideal for production decision

**Option C: 1 Week**
- Ultimate data set
- Captures all market conditions
- Best for serious deployment

### How to Stop

**Press Ctrl+C in the terminal**

**What Happens:**
1. Launcher stops all chains gracefully
2. Displays final statistics:
   - Total opportunities per chain
   - Opportunities per minute
   - Error counts
   - Runtime

**Example Output:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    📊 FINAL STATISTICS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🟣 Polygon     🟢 STOPPED
   Runtime: 86400s | Opportunities: 1234 | Errors: 5
   Last opportunity: 15s ago

🟡 BSC         🟢 STOPPED
   Runtime: 86400s | Opportunities: 567 | Errors: 2
   Last opportunity: 45s ago

🔵 Base        🟢 STOPPED
   Runtime: 86400s | Opportunities: 234 | Errors: 1
   Last opportunity: 120s ago

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Total Opportunities: 2035 | Total Errors: 8 | Active: 0/3
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## 📊 Analyzing Results

### Step 1: Review Terminal Output

**Look for:**
- Total opportunities per chain
- Opportunities per minute
- Error rate percentage
- Which chain was most active

### Step 2: Calculate Profitability

**Formula:**
```
Potential Profit = (Spread % - Gas Cost %) × Trade Size × Frequency
```

**Example (Polygon):**
```
Spread: 0.8%
Gas: ~$0.02 = ~0.04% on $50 trade
Net Spread: 0.76%
Frequency: 0.8 opp/min = 48 opp/hour = 1,152 opp/day
Trade Size: $50
Potential: $50 × 0.76% × 1,152 = $438/day
```

**Compare across all 3 chains**

### Step 3: Identify Best Chain

**Ranking Criteria:**
1. **Frequency × Spread** (overall score)
2. **Consistency** (stable over time?)
3. **Error Rate** (reliability)
4. **Gas Costs** (profitability)

**Example Decision Matrix:**

| Chain | Frequency | Avg Spread | Score | Gas | Rank |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------|-----|------|
| Polygon | 0.8/min | 0.8% | 0.64 | $0.02 | 🥇 1st |
| BSC | 0.4/min | 1.2% | 0.48 | $0.20 | 🥈 2nd |
| Base | 0.2/min | 0.6% | 0.12 | $0.02 | 🥉 3rd |

### Step 4: Check Time-of-Day Patterns

**Manual Tracking (Optional):**
- Note time when most opportunities occur
- Compare Asian hours vs US hours vs European hours
- Identify best trading windows

**Questions to Answer:**
- Does Polygon peak during specific hours?
- Does BSC peak during Asian trading?
- Does Base peak during US trading?

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: One Chain Stopped
**Symptom:** Only 2/3 chains showing activity

**Solution:**
1. Stop all (Ctrl+C)
2. Check which chain had issues
3. Run specific test: `node scripts/test-[chain]-config.js`
4. Fix RPC endpoint if needed
5. Restart: `node scripts/multi-chain-launcher.js`

### Issue: Too Many Errors
**Symptom:** High error count on one chain

**Solution:**
1. Check if WebSocket disconnects are frequent
2. May be RPC rate limiting
3. Consider switching to backup WebSocket
4. Or run that chain separately with different RPC

### Issue: No Opportunities
**Symptom:** Hours running but zero opportunities

**Potential Causes:**
1. Low market volatility (normal during stable periods)
2. All prices aligned (arbitrage closed quickly)
3. Configuration issue (check pools are connected)

**Solution:**
- Wait longer (volatility will return)
- Check status updates show pools are active
- Verify WebSocket connections are live

### Issue: High Memory Usage
**Symptom:** RAM usage keeps growing

**Solution:**
1. Stop monitoring (Ctrl+C)
2. This is a known Node.js issue with long-running processes
3. Restart monitoring
4. Consider restarting every 12-24 hours if needed

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Start During High Volatility
- Monday morning (Asia/Europe open)
- During major crypto news events
- When Bitcoin is moving significantly

### 2. Note External Factors
Keep track of:
- Major crypto news
- Market-wide volatility
- Chain-specific events (upgrades, outages)
- Your notes help explain anomalies

### 3. Take Snapshots
Every 6-12 hours:
1. Check current statistics
2. Take screenshot or note numbers
3. Track progress over time
4. Build time-series data

### 4. Monitor System Health
- Check Task Manager/Activity Monitor
- CPU should be low (5-15% per process)
- Memory should be stable (not growing)
- Network activity should be steady
