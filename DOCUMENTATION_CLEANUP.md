## üìà ROADMAP UPDATE

### Updated in PROJECT_STATUS.md

**‚úÖ Completed (as of Oct 18, 2025):**
- Smart contract deployed to Polygon
- Bot fully functional
- 83 tokens configured and validated
- Data logging system integrated
- All compilation errors fixed
- Configuration validated

**üîÑ In Progress:**
- 24-hour data collection test ‚Üê **YOU ARE HERE**

**‚è≥ Pending (Next Steps):**
- Data analysis
- Slippage protection
- MEV protection
- Live trading (small amounts)
- Scaling based on results

**üõ†Ô∏è What Needs Fixing:**

**Critical (Before Live):**
1. Slippage protection - No min output validation
2. Gas price monitoring - Real-time checks needed
3. Profit validation - Ensure profit > costs

**Important (Soon):**
1. MEV protection - Frontrunning vulnerability
2. Error recovery - Better failed transaction handling
3. RPC redundancy - Fallback providers
4. Rate limiting - Avoid throttling

**Nice to Have (Future):**
1. Telegram alerts
2. Web dashboard
3. Auto-restart
4. Historical analysis

## üéâ BENEFITS OF CLEANUP

### Before:
- ‚ùå 20+ .md files with overlapping info

- ‚ùå Outdated deployment info
- ‚ùå No single source of truth
- ‚ùå Confusing what to read first

### After:
- ‚úÖ Clear hierarchy: README ‚Üí PROJECT_STATUS ‚Üí QUICK_START
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth (PROJECT_STATUS.md)
- ‚úÖ 5-minute startup path (QUICK_START.md)
- ‚úÖ Current status always visible

## üìä KEY INSIGHTS FROM CONSOLIDATION

### What's Actually Working:
1. Smart contract deployed on Polygon mainnet
2. Bot compiles and runs without errors
3. 83 tokens configured properly
4. Data logging system fully integrated
5. All validation scripts working

### What's Actually Pending:
1. **24-hour test** - Never run yet!
2. **Data analysis** - No data collected yet
3. **Slippage protection** - Critical missing feature
4. **Live trading** - Not tested in production
5. **Profitability** - Unknown until tested

### Reality Check:
- **Current Phase:** Pre-production testing (dry run)
- **Capital Invested:** ~$20 (for gas)
- **Expected First Test:** This weekend
- **Go-Live Date:** After successful 24h test + fixes
- **Profit Expectations:** Unknown - must test first
