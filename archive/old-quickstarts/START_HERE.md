## üöÄ YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)

Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\danyw\Documents\Git\DanywayGit\OnChainArbitrage

# Install all packages
npm install
```

This will install approximately 300MB of dependencies including:
- Hardhat and plugins
- ethers.js v6
- OpenZeppelin contracts
- Aave V3 contracts
- TypeScript and testing tools

**Expected time:** 3-5 minutes

---

### Step 2: Set Up Environment (2 minutes)

```powershell
# Copy the environment template
Copy-Item .env.example .env

# Edit with Notepad or VS Code
notepad .env
# or
code .env
```

**Minimum configuration needed:**

```env
# Get FREE API keys from https://www.alchemy.com/
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY_HERE
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY_HERE

# For testnet (use a NEW wallet, not your main one!)
ARBITRUM_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://arb-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY_HERE

# Use a testnet-only wallet private key
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE # NEVER use your main wallet!

# Bot settings (safe defaults)
MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD=0.5
MAX_GAS_PRICE=100
ENABLE_DRY_RUN=true
```

---

### Step 3: Get Free Alchemy API Keys (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://www.alchemy.com/
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create app for:
   - Arbitrum One (Mainnet)
   - Arbitrum Sepolia (Testnet)
   - Polygon PoS (Mainnet)
4. Copy API keys to your `.env` file

**Note:** Free tier includes:
- 300 million compute units/month
- Enough for development and testing
- No credit card required

---

### Step 4: Create Testnet Wallet (3 minutes)

**IMPORTANT:** Never use your main wallet for testing!

```powershell
# Generate new wallet using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

This generates a random private key. Use this for testing only!

To get the address from private key:
```javascript
// In Node.js or browser console
const ethers = require('ethers');
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet('0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY');
console.log('Address:', wallet.address);
```

---

### Step 5: Get Testnet Funds (5 minutes)

#### Ethereum Sepolia Testnet ETH (Get This First):
1. **Google Cloud Faucet** (BEST - No Requirements)
   - Visit: https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia
   - Get 0.05 ETH per day
   - No mainnet ETH required
   - Use this to bridge to Arbitrum Sepolia if needed

#### Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet ETH:
1. **QuickNode Faucet** (Recommended)
   - Visit: https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia
   - No mainnet ETH required
   - Simple captcha verification
   - Get 0.1-0.5 testnet ETH

2. **Alchemy Faucet** (Requires Mainnet ETH)
   - Visit: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/arbitrum-sepolia
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires 0.01 ETH on Arbitrum mainnet
   - Get 0.05 Arbitrum Sepolia ETH every 72 hours
   - Only use if you have mainnet ETH

#### Alternative Faucets:
- Chainlink: https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia
- Triangle Platform: https://faucet.triangleplatform.com/arbitrum/sepolia
- LearnWeb3: https://learnweb3.io/faucets/arbitrum_sepolia

**You need:** ~0.1 testnet ETH to start

---

### Step 6: Compile Contracts (1 minute)

```powershell
npm run compile
```

Expected output:
```
Compiled 15 Solidity files successfully
‚úì Compiled successfully
```

This creates:
- `artifacts/` - Contract ABIs
- `typechain-types/` - TypeScript types
- `cache/` - Compilation cache

---

### Step 7: Run Tests (2 minutes)

```powershell
npm test
```

**Note:** First run will take longer (downloading forked state)

Expected output:
```
  FlashLoanArbitrage
    ‚úì Should deploy successfully
    ‚úì Should set authorized executors
    ‚úì Should execute arbitrage
    ...
  15 passing (5s)
```

---

### Step 8: Deploy to Testnet (2 minutes)

```powershell
npm run deploy:testnet
```

Expected output:
```
üöÄ Deploying FlashLoanArbitrage contract...
üì° Network: arbitrum-sepolia (Chain ID: 421614)
üìç Using Aave V3 Pool Address Provider: 0x0496...
‚úÖ FlashLoanArbitrage deployed to: 0xabcd...
üë§ Deployed by: 0x1234...

üìù Deployment Summary:
========================
Network: arbitrum-sepolia
Contract Address: 0xabcd1234...
========================
```

**üéâ SAVE THIS CONTRACT ADDRESS!** You'll need it later.
