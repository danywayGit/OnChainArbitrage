# 🟣 Polygon Mainnet Deployment Guide

## ✅ Configuration Complete!

Your bot is now configured for **Polygon mainnet** - the cheapest mainnet option!

---

## 📊 Why Polygon?

| Feature | Ethereum | Polygon |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Gas Cost per Trade** | $30-100 | **$0.01-0.05** ✅ |
| **Block Time** | ~12 seconds | **2 seconds** ✅ |
| **Flash Loan Fee** | 0.05% | **0.05%** (same) |
| **Total Cost (1000 USDC trade)** | $30.50+ | **$0.51-0.55** ✅ |
| **Liquidity** | Highest | High (billions) ✅ |

**Polygon is 600-2000x cheaper than Ethereum!** 🚀

## 🎯 What Was Updated

### 1. **src/config.ts**
```typescript
✅ Network: Changed to Polygon (chainId: 137)
✅ RPC: Using POLYGON_RPC_URL
✅ Aave: Updated to Polygon Aave V3 address
✅ Tokens: All Polygon mainnet token addresses
✅ DEXes: QuickSwap, Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, Curve, Balancer

✅ ENABLE_DRY_RUN=true (start safe!)
✅ Added CONTRACT_ADDRESS placeholder
```

### 3. **Trading Parameters**
```typescript
✅ Min profit: 0.3% (lower because gas is cheap!)
✅ Max gas: 500 Gwei (~$0.02-0.05)
✅ Max trade: $1000 (start small)
✅ Min balance: 1 MATIC (~$0.50-1)
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Get MATIC for Gas ⛽

You need **~5-10 MATIC** (~$3-6) for:
- Contract deployment: ~2-3 MATIC
- Testing trades: ~2-5 MATIC
- Reserve: ~2 MATIC

**How to get MATIC:**

1. **Buy on CEX** (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)
2. **Withdraw to your wallet** on Polygon network
3. **Or bridge from Ethereum** (but costs gas!)

**Your wallet address:** Check your PRIVATE_KEY in .env

### Step 2: Fund Your Wallet

```bash
# Check your wallet balance
npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.ts --network polygon
```

Expected output:
```
Wallet: 0xYourAddress
MATIC Balance: 10.0 MATIC
Ready to deploy! ✅
```

### Step 3: Deploy Contract to Polygon

```bash
# Deploy your FlashLoanArbitrage contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network polygon
```

Expected output:
```
Deploying FlashLoanArbitrage to Polygon...
✅ Contract deployed to: 0xYourContractAddress
Gas used: 2.5 MATIC (~$1.50)
```

**⚠️ SAVE THE CONTRACT ADDRESS!**

### Step 4: Update Configuration

Add the deployed address to `.env`:

```bash
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
```

### Step 5: Verify Contract (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network polygon YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "0xa97684ead0e402dC232d5A977953DF7ECBaB3CDb"
```

This verifies your contract on PolygonScan.

### Step 6: Test in Dry Run Mode

```bash
# Start bot in DRY RUN mode (safe!)
npm run bot
```

Expected output:
```
🤖 Arbitrage Bot Starting...
Network: Polygon (137)
Mode: DRY RUN ✅
Monitoring 3 pairs...

🔍 Checking WMATIC/USDC...
   QuickSwap: 1 WMATIC = $0.60
   Uniswap V3: 1 WMATIC = $0.605
   Opportunity: 0.83% profit! 🎯

💡 DRY RUN: Would execute trade
   Trade size: $500
   Gross profit: $4.15
   Flash loan fee: $0.25
   Gas cost: $0.02
   Net profit: $3.88 ✅
```

### Step 7: Monitor for 24 Hours

Run in dry run mode for at least 24 hours:
- Verify opportunities are real
- Check profit calculations
- Ensure no errors
- Confirm gas costs are low

### Step 8: Enable Live Trading (When Ready!)

Only after successful dry run testing:

```bash
# Update .env
ENABLE_DRY_RUN=false
```

**⚠️ START SMALL!**
- First 10 trades: Max $100 each
- Next 50 trades: Max $500 each
- Then scale to $1000+

## 💰 Expected Profitability

### Conservative Estimate (Polygon):

```
Assumptions:
- Average trade size: $500
- Average profit margin: 0.5%
- Flash loan fee: 0.05%
- Gas cost: $0.03
- Successful trades per day: 10

Daily Profit:
├─ Gross profit per trade: $2.50 (0.5%)
├─ Flash loan fee: -$0.25 (0.05%)
├─ Gas cost: -$0.03
├─ Net profit per trade: $2.22
└─ Daily total (10 trades): $22.20

Monthly Profit: $666
Annual Profit: $8,103
Capital needed: $0 (flash loans!)

ROI: INFINITE! 🚀
```

### Optimistic Estimate:

```
If you find 0.8% opportunities and do 20 trades/day:

Daily Profit: $70-100
Monthly Profit: $2,100-3,000
Annual Profit: $25,000-36,000

Still $0 capital needed!
```

## 🎯 Polygon-Specific Tips

### 1. **Best DEX Pairs**

Most liquid on Polygon:
```typescript
✅ WMATIC/USDC (highest volume)
✅ WETH/USDC (popular)
✅ WMATIC/WETH (native pair)
✅ USDC/USDT (stablecoins - tight margins)
```

### 2. **Gas Optimization**

On Polygon, gas is so cheap you can:
- Execute more trades (even smaller margins)
- Try more opportunities (low risk)
- Test strategies aggressively

### 3. **MEV Protection**

Polygon has **less MEV competition** than Ethereum:
- Fewer bots
- Easier to catch opportunities
- Less front-running

### 4. **Liquidity Pools**

Major DEXes on Polygon:
```
QuickSwap: $500M+ TVL (most popular)
Uniswap V3: $300M+ TVL
SushiSwap: $200M+ TVL
Curve: $100M+ TVL (stablecoins)
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Track These Metrics:

1. **Profitability**
   - Gross profit per trade
   - Net profit after fees
   - Success rate

2. **Costs**
   - Gas costs per trade
   - Flash loan fees
   - Total daily costs

3. **Opportunities**
   - Total opportunities found
   - Opportunities executed
   - Missed opportunities (why?)

4. **Performance**
   - Average execution time
   - Block delay
   - Slippage encountered

---

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Insufficient MATIC for gas"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check balance
npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.ts --network polygon

# Need more MATIC? Buy on CEX and withdraw to Polygon
```

### Issue 2: "Transaction underpriced"

**Solution:**
```typescript
// In config.ts, increase maxGasPrice
maxGasPrice: 1000, // Try higher
```

### Issue 3: "No opportunities found"

**Solution:**
- Normal during low volatility
- Try different pairs
- Lower minProfitBps (but watch gas costs)
- Check if DEX pools have liquidity

### Issue 4: "Flash loan reverted: Error 27"

**Solution:**
- DEX swap failed (insufficient liquidity)
- Try smaller trade sizes
- Check slippage tolerance
- Verify token addresses are correct
