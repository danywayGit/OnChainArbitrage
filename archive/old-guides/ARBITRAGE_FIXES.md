# 🔧 Arbitrage Bot Fixes - Low Gas Cost Trading

## Date: October 18, 2025

---

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

### **Problem 1: All Trades Used Same DEX** ❌
**Issue:** Bot detected price differences between Curve, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, etc., but executed BOTH trades on Uniswap router.

**Result:** Every trade lost money because:
- No actual arbitrage (same DEX = same price)
- Double swap fees (0.6% total)
- Error: `"UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT"`

**Fix:** ✅ Created `src/dexRouter.ts` with proper DEX router mapping
- Maps each DEX name to actual router address
- QuickSwap → `0xa5E0829CaCEd8fFDD4De3c43696c57F7D7A678ff`
- SushiSwap → `0x1b02dA8Cb0d097eB8D57A175b88c7D8b47997506`
- Curve → `0x445FE580eF8d70FF569aB36e80c647af338db351`
- etc.

### **Problem 2: No Profitability Validation** ❌
**Issue:** Bot executed trades without checking if they'd actually be profitable after fees and gas.

**Result:** Most "opportunities" would lose money due to:
- DEX swap fees: 0.3% × 2 = 0.6%
- Flash loan fee: 0.09%
- Gas costs: $0.50 - $5.00 on Polygon
- Slippage: 0.5% - 2%

**Fix:** ✅ Added `validateProfitability()` function that calculates:
```
Net Profit = Spread - (DEX Fees + Flash Loan Fee + Gas Cost + Slippage)
```

Only executes if:
- Net profit > $1.00
- Spread > Total fees
- Gas cost < Gross profit

---

### **Problem 3: High Gas Cost DEXes** ❌
**Issue:** Some DEXes (Balancer, Uniswap V3) use complex math requiring 600k+ gas units.

**Cost on Polygon:**
- Simple DEX (QuickSwap): ~400k gas = $0.50 - $2
- Complex DEX (Balancer): ~700k gas = $1 - $5
- **Total for arbitrage:** 2× DEX gas + flash loan overhead

**At high gas prices:** Could exceed $10+ making arbitrage unprofitable

**Fix:** ✅ Added gas cost filtering in `isDexPairEfficient()`
- Estimates gas cost per DEX based on complexity
- Rejects trades where total gas > $10
- Prefers efficient DEXes:
  - ✅ Curve: ~350k gas (best for stablecoins)
  - ✅ QuickSwap: ~400k gas (most popular)
  - ✅ SushiSwap: ~400k gas (good alternative)
  - ❌ Balancer: ~700k gas (too expensive)
  - ❌ Uniswap V3: ~600k gas (complex)

## 📊 **New Trade Flow**

```
1. Detect price difference
   ↓
2. ✅ Check DEX gas costs (< $10 total)
   ↓
3. ✅ Map DEX names to actual routers
   ↓
4. ✅ Verify profitability after all fees
   ↓
5. Execute only if profitable
```

## 💰 **Realistic Profit Expectations**

### **What You'll See:**

**Most opportunities:** ❌ **NOT PROFITABLE**
```
Price spread: 1.5%
- DEX fees: -0.6%
- Flash loan: -0.09%
- Gas: -$2.00
- Slippage: -0.5%
= Net: 0.31% profit on $100 = $0.31
But gas costs $2, so NET LOSS: -$1.69
```

**Rare profitable opportunities:** ✅ **MAYBE PROFITABLE**
```
Price spread: 3.0% (very rare!)
- DEX fees: -0.6%
- Flash loan: -0.09%
- Gas: -$1.50
- Slippage: -0.3%
= Gross: 2.01% profit on $500 = $10.05
- Gas: -$1.50
= Net profit: $8.55 ✅
```

### **Reality Check:**

**On Polygon (where gas is cheap):**
- Profitable opportunities: 1-5 per day
- Average profit when found: $2-10
- Competition: High (many bots)
- Execution speed critical: < 1 second

**Why it's hard:**
1. MEV bots front-run you
2. Opportunities disappear in seconds
3. Large trades cause slippage
4. Best opportunities taken instantly

## 🚀 **What to Do Next**

### **Option 1: Test with Fixed Code (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run bot
```

**You'll see:**
- ✅ Correct DEX router usage
- ✅ Gas cost filtering in action
- ✅ Profitability validation
- ❌ Most trades rejected as unprofitable (this is GOOD!)

### **Option 2: Adjust Parameters for More Opportunities**

Edit `src/config.ts`:
```typescript
trading: {
  minProfitBps: 10,  // Lower from 30 to 10 (0.1% minimum)
  minTradeSize: 100, // Increase from $50 to $100
  maxTradeSize: 2000, // Increase from $1000 to $2000
}
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Lower thresholds = more false positives

### **Option 3: Focus on Specific Pairs**

Best pairs for arbitrage on Polygon:
- **Stablecoins:** USDC/USDT/DAI (use Curve - lowest fees!)
- **WMATIC/USDC:** Highest volume
- **WETH/USDC:** Good liquidity
- **WBTC/WETH:** Less competition

Edit `src/config.ts` → `watchedPairs` to enable only these.

## 📈 **How to Improve Profitability**

### **1. Add MEV Protection (Critical!)**
```bash
# Use Flashbots/MEV-Boost to submit private transactions
# Prevents front-running
# Implementation: ~1 week of work
```

### **2. Optimize Trade Size**
Current: Fixed $50-100
Better: Calculate optimal size based on:
- Pool liquidity depth
- Slippage curves
- Gas cost amortization

### **3. Multi-Hop Arbitrage**
Current: Token A → B → A (2 hops)
Better: Token A → B → C → A (3 hops)
- More complex
- Less competition
- Higher potential profit

### **4. Cross-Chain Arbitrage**
Instead of Polygon DEX → Polygon DEX:
- Polygon → Ethereum (via bridge)
- Polygon → BSC (via bridge)
- Spreads often 2-5%
- Less competition (slower)

## ⚙️ **Configuration for Low Gas Trading**

Your bot now automatically:

✅ **Prefers low-gas DEXes:**
- Curve (stablecoins)
- QuickSwap
- SushiSwap

❌ **Avoids high-gas DEXes:**
- Balancer (complex pools)
- Uniswap V3 (concentrated liquidity)

✅ **Rejects trades where:**
- Total gas > $10
- Net profit < $1
- Spread < Fees

✅ **Uses actual DEX routers:**
- No more "same DEX twice" errors
- Real arbitrage across different liquidity sources

---

## 🔍 **Monitoring Your Bot**

Run and watch the logs:

```bash
npm run bot
```

**Good signs:** ✅
```
✅ DEX pair efficient! Estimated gas cost: $1.23
🔀 Buy DEX: Curve → Router: 0x445F...
🔀 Sell DEX: SushiSwap → Router: 0x1b02...
✅ Trade IS profitable! Estimated net profit: $5.43
```

**Expected rejections:** ⚠️ (This is normal!)
```
❌ DEX pair rejected: Total gas cost ($12.34) exceeds $10 limit
❌ Trade NOT profitable: Spread (45 bps) < Fees (75 bps)
❌ Trade NOT profitable: Gas cost ($3.50) > Gross profit ($2.10)
```

## 💡 **Key Takeaways**

1. **Most arbitrage opportunities are NOT profitable** after fees/gas
2. **Your bot now filters these out** - fewer trades, but smarter
3. **Gas costs matter!** $10 gas eats all profit on small trades
4. **Polygon is best** for learning - gas is cheap ($0.50-$2 vs $50-$200 on Ethereum)
5. **Competition is fierce** - MEV bots execute in < 1 second
6. **Realistic expectations:** 1-5 profitable trades per day, $2-$10 profit each

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. ✅ **Test the fixed bot** - See the new filtering in action
2. 📊 **Collect 24h of data** - Understand opportunity frequency
3. 🎯 **Focus on best pairs** - Stablecoins on Curve are most profitable
4. 🚀 **Consider alternatives:**
   - Liquidation bot (5-10% profit per liquidation)
   - Statistical arbitrage (manual trading on large spreads)
   - Cross-chain arbitrage (2-5% spreads, less competition)

Remember: **The goal isn't to execute many trades - it's to execute PROFITABLE trades.**

Your bot is now smart enough to say "no" to losing opportunities! 🎯
