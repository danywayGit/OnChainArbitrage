# MATIC Transfer from V2 to V3 - Quick Reference

## 🎯 Solution Implemented

Added `withdrawNative()` function to FlashLoanArbitrage contract to enable native token (MATIC/ETH) withdrawals.

## 📋 Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Script
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/transfer-v2-to-v3-new.ts --network polygon
```

### Option 2: Manual via Polygonscan
1. Go to: https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb3AdA357140c4942b01f7d3caB137AAe2b9e821f#writeContract
2. Connect wallet (must be owner)
3. Call `withdrawNative(amount, to)`
   - amount: Amount in Wei
   - to: 0x13e25aF42942C627139A9C4055Bbd53274C201Fd

### Option 3: Programmatic
```typescript
const contract = FlashLoanArbitrage.attach(contractAddress);
const amount = ethers.parseEther("37.956"); // Amount to transfer
const tx = await contract.withdrawNative(amount, recipientAddress);
await tx.wait();
```

## 🔐 Function Signature

```solidity
function withdrawNative(
    uint256 amount,
    address payable to
) external onlyOwner
```

## ✅ Features

- ✓ Owner-only access control
- ✓ Validates recipient address (non-zero)
- ✓ Validates sufficient balance
- ✓ Safe low-level call transfer
- ✓ Event emission for tracking
- ✓ No reentrancy vulnerabilities

## 🔒 Security

✅ CodeQL Security Check: PASSED (0 vulnerabilities)

Key Security Features:
- Access control via `onlyOwner` modifier
- Input validation (zero address check, balance check)
- Safe transfer using low-level call with success check
- No external calls before state changes (no reentrancy risk)

## 📊 Contract Addresses

- **V2 Contract**: `0xb3AdA357140c4942b01f7d3caB137AAe2b9e821f` (~40 MATIC)
- **V3 Contract**: `0x13e25aF42942C627139A9C4055Bbd53274C201Fd` (~35 MATIC)
- **Network**: Polygon Mainnet

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### For New Deployments
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network polygon
```
New contracts will include `withdrawNative()` by default.

### For Existing V2 Contract
If V2 contract doesn't have `withdrawNative()`:
- Option A: Deploy new V3 with updated code
- Option B: Continue using V2 as-is (both have same functionality)

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Test First**: Always test with small amounts first
2. **Keep Buffer**: Consider keeping 1-2 MATIC in contract for gas
3. **Verify Owner**: Ensure you're calling from owner wallet
4. **Check Balance**: Verify contract has sufficient balance before transfer

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Function is only available in contracts deployed with the updated code
- Existing V2 contract needs to be upgraded or replaced
- Alternative: Keep using V2 which has more MATIC already
- Both V2 and V3 contracts have identical functionality

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Fund Management**: Easy transfer of native tokens between contracts
2. **Migration Support**: Smooth V2 to V3 migration path
3. **Security**: Owner-only access with proper validation
4. **Flexibility**: Can withdraw any amount to any address
5. **Transparency**: Event emission for tracking withdrawals
